# Code-Off
Code Off is an initiative that challenges developers to take 30 minutes off a Friday afternoon to work on something interesting with their peers. Code Off also aims to help developers expand their Github portfolio and collaborate with the development community. Each Friday afternoon at 15:30 CAT a new problem will be released on Github. Fork the repository, and get started.
The automated leaderboard is still in development. We encourage you to collaborate with other developers on Github.

# How to Participate?
Fork the Code Off repo and push your solution to your fork.

# Notice
The leaderboard is currently outdated and we're in the process of automating and updating it.

#Code Off #9 - Bomberman: Aftermath

##Premise
With reference to the [Entelect Challenge](http://challenge.entelect.co.za).
You're bomberman. You're given a block of walls that have been exploded. You need to determine the sequence of bombs used to destory the walls.
Please see Code Off #8 as a reference.

##Challenge
The radius of walls destroyed by a bomb is specified by the number on the bomb. Each bomb explodes vertically and horizontally, but never diagonally. If a bomb is adjacent to another bomb (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) its radius increases by 1 for each adjacent bomb.
Determine the position and radius of the bombs by marking them on the map.
There are many combinations that will work. There is no one correct solution.

##Legend
```
# = Wall
x = A number indicating the radius of the bomb
* = Destroyed wall
```
##Constraints
* The width and height of the grid will always be the same.
* The width and height of the grid may be sized between 16x16 and 1021x1021.
